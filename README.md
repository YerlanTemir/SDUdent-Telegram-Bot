This is self learning project aimed to make life of students of my university easier. Bot solves problems that I met during my student life. It has 2 main functionalities:



1. Notify about new grades

	 **Problem**:After passing midterm exams students everytime enters to
	 [portal](https://my.sdu.edu.kz/) to check, if there is new grade or not

	 **Solution**: Get student's authorization data(student number & password) , parse his/her grades data from portal, save it in database, continuously parse it and check for difference with grades in database,if there is a difference,tell him/her, update grades in database each time .

	 **Pseudocode:**


	>
	>     while True:
	> 	     for user in database.users:
	> 	         new_grades = get_grades_from_portal(user['username'],user['password'])
	> 	         old_grades = user['semester_data']
	> 	         difference = old_grades - new_grades
	> 	         if difference:
	> 	             notify_user(chat_id = user['chat']
	> 	             update_grade_in_database()
	>



2. Find sdudent by photo

 	 **Problem**: You liked/need someone but don't know his/her name and program,but have a photo?

	 **Solution**: Use pretrained deep-learning model to get feature vector of user photo. User photo can be found in portal .

	 This is how our portal looks like,from this page get user's photo,full name,program . Pass user's photo through pretrained model and get feature vector , data(feature_vector,full_name,program) in database.

	 When another user calls `/find_user` command and send photo, get feature vector of sent photo and compare with all other user's photo's feature vector by cosine similarity

	    <img width="100" src="images/cos_sim.png">
	</p>

	  **Pseudocode:**




       photo = user.message.photo.get_file()
       current_feature_vector = pretrained_model(photo)
       #shape = [1,512]
       max_sim = 0
       for user in database.users:
            similarity = cos_sim(current_feature_vector,user['feature']
	    if max_sum < similarity:
	        max_sim = similarity

        send message about user with highest similarity
